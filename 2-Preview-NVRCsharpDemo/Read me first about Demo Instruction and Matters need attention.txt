¡¾Demo Instruction¡¿
-------------------------------------
1. Login to automatically get all analog channels and IP channels

2. Preview, capture, client recording basic functions, including capture BMP and JPEG format (including saving captures in the buffer)

3. Increase the right-click IP channel setting (add, modify, delete) function on the channel list, where the streaming mode only supports to receive streaming directly from the device (NET_DVR_IPCHANINFO, NET_DVR_IPCHANINFO_V40)

4. In the bin folder, there is a compiled executable (Release version). The SDK log save path: "C:\\SdkLog\\"

¡¾Matters need attention¡¿
------------------------------------
1. Please download the latest version of the device network SDK from Hikvision official website: https://overseasadmin.hikvision.com/en/Support/Downloads/SDK

2. If you do integration you need to copy files in SDK package [lib] folder to your project.

   Please make sure that HCNetSDKCom(including the function component dll library file inside) is in the same folder with HCNetSDK.dll,HCCore.dll. Meanwhile, the name of HCNetSDKCom can¡¯t be changed.
 
   As for this demo,you do not need to copy any files. All the library files required are already in [bin] folder.

3. If the software you developed do not integrate functions properly and the program does not specify the path to the loaded dll library, try to remove HCNetSDK.dll while the program is running. 

   If it can be deleted, the program may call the dll file in the Windows->System32 directory of the system disk. It is recommended to delete or update the relevant dll file in the directory.

   If it cannot be deleted, right-click the dll file to select the attribute to confirm the SDK library version.

4. If the corresponding function cannot be implemented after the above steps, please judge the reason according to the error number returned by call NET_DVR_GetLastError.
